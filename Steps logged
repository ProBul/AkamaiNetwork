Created an account in AWS
Launched 3 EC2 instances with the default VPC and Subnets - Managed to connect.
Created a new VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and subnet to set the internal IP according to requirements
I created security groups according to the requirements.
Associated the EC2 instances with a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and subnet I created - couldn't connect to the servers.
Changed back to the default VPC and Subnet 
Connect to the first machine by using Git Bash from the .pem key location: 'ssh -i MachineA24.pem ubuntu@ec2-13-60-43-171.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com'

Ran the Ansible requirement on machine A from within the machine manually before doing so via Ansible-
    Run 'sudo apt update' to make sure all packages are up to date
    Run 'sudo apt install Haproxy' to install haproxy
    Run 'sudo ufw allow 443/tcp' to allow traffic through TCP port 443
Manual configuration completed successfully

I have created a new EC2 machine for Ansible.
Connect to Ansible: 'ssh -i MachineA24.pem ubuntu@ec2-16-171-10-3.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com'

Update to the lateset packages and install Ansible-
Run 'sudo apt update'
Run 'sudo apt install ansible'

Create a hosts file for ansible: 'sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts'
Change the permissions to writable by running 'sudo chmod 700' command
Create an Ansible inventory file

     172.31.46.38
     172.31.43.141
Generated SSH Key Pair to be able to communicate with the other EC2 machines passwordless by running 'ssh-keygen -t rsa' (Without providing password )
Copy the public key to the other by running 'ssh-copy-id user@3.9.146.62', 'ssh-copy-id user@18.132.16.100' - Got an error 'Permission denied (publickey)'
Tried to debug but couldn't manage to make it work.
